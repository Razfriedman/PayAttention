COVID-19 forced teams around the world to transition their communications online. While Work from home is preferred for some of us, the limitations of video conference-calls decrease your team's productivity. We are here to help you understand your team better. In-person communications allow us to read each other’s body language which we unconsciously interpret as emotional communication.

PayAttention will help you better understand your team’s emotional response to your slides, talking-points, and feedback. These unprecedented times changed the way we engage with others, and we are here to change HOW we understand each other.
